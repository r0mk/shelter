Hi Doge!
1)Ispconfig does not allow to put user to second group.
We testing manual adding user to group and changing permission. Of files.

2)Jira switched to HTTPS. JIra cant work with http and https simultaniously. 
I am add https connector in conf/server.xml and change proxy url in apache sites-available/900-kryptoversal.vhost 
backup available in /root/backup
3)Now jira version 7.12.1 from 3/Oct/18
full backup of Jira and Database in /root/backup
4)PHP upgraded to version 7.1.22
Mongo issue was fixed by installing new packet php-mongodb. It was not installed. Previously someone use mongodb.so from pecl, but it was not working with new php for some reason.
